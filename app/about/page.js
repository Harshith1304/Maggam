          I live in Sircilla, a town in Telangana that the rest of the state associates with one thing: cloth. Looms are not a
          metaphor here. They are a trade, a daily sound, a craft that gets better only by repeating itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted my writing to feel like that. Not a mood that arrives on good days, but a seat I return to, a few threads at a
          time, whether or not the day feels worth it. So the site is built like cloth, and the name came before the colours did.
